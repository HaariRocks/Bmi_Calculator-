# BMI Calculator

A new Flutter project.

## Aim 
To Design A Beautiful Body Mass Index Calculator Using Flutter 

## About
Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women. Enter your weight and height using standard or metric measures.

### How do I calculate my BMI?
Body Mass Index is a simple calculation using a person's height and weight. The formula is "BMI = kg/m2" where kg is a person's weight in kilograms and m2 is their height in metres squared.

## Final Output
It will be a multi screen app with simple functionality but full-on custom styling.
